# predicting Molecular Properties

This is a guided project using past competition from Kaggle
* [Kaggle Champs Scalar Coupling](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/overview)

Skill Demonstrated
* Data Manipulation and Visualization
* Exploratory Analysis
* Define a function to eutomate fitting and predicting atoms interaction using Light Gradient Boosting Regressor models.

**Overview** <br>
Predicted scalar constant number to generate a fast and reliable method to identify molecular properties. Ran exploratory data analysis on approximately 5 million records and identified different behaviors from different molecule types. Built a function to automate fitting and predicting interaction between 2 atoms using Light Gradient Boosting Regressor models. Developed 8 different models for different molecule types; obtained an average log mean absolute error of -0.3.
