## Alice Pham's Data Analysis Porfolio

### Hi! You're in the Master Branch.
This is my data analysis portfolio. Most of the projects are from the classes I took, so I have hidden them from Google searches by putting them in the `personal branch`. Please switch to [personal](https://github.com/Naliph/DS-Portfolio/tree/personal) to see my work. 

Also, I have a colorful blog hosting my class notes including data visualizations and manipulation. I would love  for you to check it out, here is the [link](https://naliph.github.io/). Thank you!
