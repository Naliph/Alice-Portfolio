## Alice Pham's Data Analysis Porfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. All of my projects are in Python language focusing on data analysis and machine learning. 
I am a B.S. Biochemistry student with an interest in data science. I took some electives involving Python for data analysis and this portfolio is a collection of my projects from class and also from self-guided from Kaggle discussions.
