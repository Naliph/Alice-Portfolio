# Penguins Clustering Analysis

This is a group project for my elective course - Python with Application (I) at UCLA.

* [Project description](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/project/)

**Skill Demonstrated**
* Data manipulation using Numpy and Pandas
* Data visualization using matplotlibs (including plot decision regions of classifier fit)
* Exploratory Data Analysis and forming hypothesis for feature selection
* Data cleaning (prepare data, encode discrete variables, and standardize data)
* Statistical modeling: Deploy three models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Neural Network) and compared them side-by-side

**Overview**<br>
In the Palmer penguins data set, our team examined the correlation between different combination of biological variables. The team then formed a hypothesis for modeling and systematically determined a small set of measurement that are highly predictive of a penguin's species. We build and compared three models of scikit-learn library for their accuracy and performance
